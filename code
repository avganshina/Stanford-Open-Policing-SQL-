#1 - Race vs. total

Compute the percentage of traffic stops by the race of the driver being stopped. (This one is done for you using an awesome way to do a subquery using the with statement):

with total as
   ( select count(*) as total from data )
select subject_race, round(count(*) * 1.0 / total.total, 3)
from data, total
group by subject_race;


Run this query on your database. What are the results? Are these results what you would expect? (You can Google basic information about the location you are analyzing in order to come up with a better idea of what you would expect).

Retrieve Necessary Information about races:

Before making any assumptions, the data about the race groups in the Database should be retrieved. For that the following query is produced:

SELECT DISTINCT subject_race
FROM data



Results:

NA
asian/pacific islander
black
hispanic
other
unknown
white




Predictions:

From a google search, the following information is available:  The 5 largest ethnic groups in Chicago, IL are White (Non-Hispanic) (33.3%), Black or African American (Non-Hispanic) (29%), White (Hispanic) (18.1%), Other (Hispanic) (8.88%), and Asian (Non-Hispanic) (6.65%). 

As a result, if there are no racial biases in Chicago area, the following results should be produced:

asian/pacific islander	0.0665		6.65%
Black				0.29		29%
Hispanic			0.2698		26.98%
White				0.333		33.3%


Results:


NA				0.735		73.5 %
asian/pacific islander	0.003		0.3 %
black				0.116		11.6 %
hispanic			0.092		9.2 %
other				0.0		0 %
unknown			0.002		0.2 %
white				0.052		5.2 %

The needed information is not provided for 73.5 % of the people. To get more relevant results, I have recalculated the percentages excluding NA, other and unknown, so the breakdown changed to:

asian/pacific islander	0.0113		1.13 %
black				0.438		43.8 %
hispanic			0.347		34.7 %
white				0.196		19.6 %


Analysis:

From the following results, it can be inferred that the racial biases affect policemen. It results into policeman stopping black and hispanic people more although the statistics of population shows that while people are prevalent in Chicago area 
#2 - Arrests vs. Race

Compute the percent of arrests made by race 

Prediction: 

According to the previous part,  because black people were stopped the most, they as well were arrested the most.

Retrieve Necessary Information about races and arrests:

In order to calculate percent of arrests by race, the following query is produced:

with total as
   ( select count(*) as total from data )
SELECT subject_race, arrest_made, round(count(*) * 1.0 / total.total, 3)
FROM data, total
GROUP BY subject_race




Results: 

NA				NA	0.735		//	73.5 	%	
asian/pacific islander		1	0.003		//	0.3   	%
black				1	0.116		//	11.6 	%
hispanic			1	0.092		//	9.2  	%
other				1	0.0		// 	0     	%
unknown			1	0.002		//	0.2  	%
white				1	0.052		// 	5.2 	%

Analysis:

As predicted the majority of the people (except NA) who got arrested are identifying as black people.

#3 - NO INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE DATABASE

If your database has information about frisks or searches, compute the percentage of searches or frisks conducted by race.
#4 - NO INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE DATABASE

If your database has information about the color of the car being driven, compute the breakdown. (The inspiration here is to check whether the police seem to be more likely to pull over red cars). What do you observe, and is it what you expect?

#5 - Stops vs. Time

Here are the number of stops by hour using the strftime function:

select tt, count(*)
from (select strftime('%H', time) as tt from data)
group by tt;


So, 0 would mean 0:00 to 0:59 (i.e. midnight to 12:59am), 1 would mean 1:00am to 1:59am, etc.

The strftime function can parse and format dates and times in various useful ways.

What patterns can you detect in the number of stops by the hour of the day?

Predictions:

Through a google search, the following information is found: The NHTSA reports that most accidents occur during "rush hour," between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.  And according to the NHTSA, Saturday is the most dangerous day of the week to drive, primarily because there are more cars – and more drunk drivers – on the road than any other day. As a result, the prediction to this question is that the number of the stops will spike from 3 pm to 6 pm.

To produce more insightful results, the following query is produced:

select tt, count(*)
from (select strftime('%H', time) as tt from data)
group by tt
order by count(*)

22	47265
18	47867
17	49571
19	50647
20	51169


Analysis:

The results show that the most stops are made from 6 to 23 pm. Although the results do not necessarily relate well to the predictions, the predicted ”dangerous hours” are the hours of the average number of stops. This can be explained by remembering that Chicago is a large, populated and business center. People in areas like that drive home after work later, after 6 pm.


#6 - Stops vs. Month

Break down the number of stops by month of the year using a similar query to the one above. What do you find? Does this fit your expectations?
Predictions:

Chicago has snow during the winter, and, as a result, that leads to more car accidents and, therefore, traffic stops as well. Because of that, months where the majority of the stops occur are predicted to be winter months: December, January, February. 

Retrieve Necessary Information about Stops during all months:

In order to divide the number of stops by month, the temporary table should be created. In this temporary table, instead of one column being mm-dd-yyyy, the temporary table will divide month, day and year.

DROP TABLE ymd;
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ymd AS
SELECT strftime('%Y',date) as year,
	strftime('%m',date) as month,
	strftime('%d',date) as day
	from data;


Retrieving necessary information and ordering it by the number of stops:

SELECT month, count(*)
from ymd
group by month
order by count(*)


Results:


12	61528
11	65966
09	69439
06	69646
04	70212
10	70706
08	71226
05	71557
02	72176
07	72206
01	73013
03	78781



In contrast to the predictions, December is the month with the least traffic stops. Instead, March is the month with the majority of the stops.
#7 - Stops vs. Race & Time

Break down the number of stops by the race of the driver and by the time of the day (you may want to split into different units, so midnight to 4am, 4am to 8am, 8am to noon, etc), and also by the race of the driver.

Predictions:

According to the previous results, the majority of the stops for all, and especially the black community, should occur from 6:00 to 23:00 pm. 

Retrieving Results about dependency of number of stops on time and race:

SELECT time, subject_race, count(*)
FROM data
WHERE subject_race = 'asian/pacific islander'
OR subject_race = 'white'
OR subject_race = 'black'
OR subject_race = 'hispanic'
GROUP BY time, subject_race
order by time

Analysis: 

For Asian/Pacific Islander  identifying people the numbers are generally increasing after 09:00:00 am when it is at minimum. The peak occurs at 23:00:00 and the most stops occur 20:00:00 to 02:00:00.

For Black identifying people the numbers are generally increasing after 05:00:00 when it is at minimum. The peak occurs at 22:00:00 and the most stops occur 16:00:00 to 02:00:00.

For hispanic identifying people the numbers are generally increasing after 05:00:00  am when it is at minimum. The peak occurs at 23:00:00 and the most stops occur 20:00:00 to 02:00:00.

For hispanic identifying people the numbers are generally increasing after 05:00:00  am when it is at minimum. The peak occurs at 23:00:00 and the most stops occur 20:00:00 to 02:00:00.

It is very interesting to see that although the majority of the population of chicago is white, they are the one before the last one in numbers of stops. Although the prediction was that the majority of the stops for all races occurred from 15:00:00 to 22:00:00, it is the case only for black identifying people. 

#8 - Most Marginalized Group

What is the most marginalized group of people? (Color, sex, age)

Prediction:

From a google search:

Driver gender: males are more likely to be stopped by the police; 
Driver race: black people are more likely to get pulled over
Driver age: Young drivers were more likely to be pulled over by police
than older drivers. One measure of this difference is that 
young drivers age 16 to 24 were a larger percentage (26%) 
of drivers stopped by police than they were of drivers in 
the United States (15.3%).

As a result, blace males ages 16 to 24 are more likely to get pulled over.

Retrieve Necessary Information about sex, race and age:

select subject_race, subject_sex, subject_age, count(*)
from data

black		male	25	2882
black		male	26	2882
black		male	22	2981
black		male	24	3088
black		male	23	3113

Analysis:

As predicted from the research, black males of age of 23 are the ones who were stopped the most.

#9 - Is White Supremacy Real?

Is white supremacy real in police? Do white policemen tend to arrest people of color more than others? Compare them to black officers.

Prediction:

Yes, so far we have learned that people of color tend to be pulled over more than others. As a result, there is a reason to believe that it might be the case.

black	NA	140451

Analysis:

As predicted, whilte officers tend to stop black drivers the most. However, after analysis of black officers, it turned out that black officers stop black drivers more as well. As a result, it can be inferred that there is an overall bias towards black people in the community.
